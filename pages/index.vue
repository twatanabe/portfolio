            <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy">
              a 24 year old digital designer and illustrator that codes based in the USA from BayamÃ³n, Puerto Rico.
              I grew up mainly in South Florida and studied print design in college, learning code, product, and
              business on my own time. I love working day-to-day on projects that require multidisciplinary
              skill sets solving complex issues that make the lives of people better. I've been designing for
              7+ years and coding for 4+ years.
            </p>
            <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy">
              I enjoy thinking about experience based solutions through use of design and technological
              implications. I find internal systematic struggles intriguing and set to solve and improve
              processes to better the way people work and interact with technology. Through merging
              expertise in product, branding, illustration, and web technologies, I can better approach
              problems for modern overarching solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy">
              I rarely take on freelance projects nowadays, but if you're working on something exciting feel
              free to reach out if I can be of any help or guidance.

              People are the essence of the technology industry. Without people, we would have no clear
              purpose in our work. I believe in helping people feel welcomed and included when it comes
              to my work and who I am as a person.

            <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy mb4">
              Unfortunately overlooked nowadays, accessibility is a very important aspect of my work.
              I believe in equal access to technology and providing the tools and refinements to style,
              typography, and code neccessary to do so.

            <H size={3}>Simplicity</H>
            <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy mb4">
              Although an overused term, Simplicity is at the heart of my goals in my work. I believe
              in a simple approach with a touch of uniqueness, developing work into the purest form
              with tasteful novelty.

            <H size={3}>Transparency</H>
            <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy mb4">
              Openly and actively sharing my process to help others is a core element of my process. I
              always try my best to share what I can for the benefit of others. I believe this is also
              important in a workplace setting in both positive and negative situations for more empathy
              and understanding.
            </p>
            <H size={3}>Ethics</H>
            <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy mb4">
              I believe that morals and ethics in design play a large part in process. Both business
              and experience decisions based on the greater good of users makes a better, more
              personable product and brand.

              <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy mb4">
                When I'm not working on design, I mainly work on new music under the alias Cordio. Besides that you'll find me spending time with my dog and my
                girlfriend, traveling, making pour overs, learning, playing video games, and eating food. My girlfriend and I make physical products and a podcast
                (where we talk about the crappy things in everyday life) in our free time.
              </p>
              <p className="black-70 f6 lh-copy mb4">
                I used to more often then now since I found this thing called a work/life balance, but every now and then I'll get the itch to design and code outside
                of my full-time job making things that I wish existed. I also want to make more of this thing they call "friends" outside of work, so I'd love to grab
                coffee or hop on a video call and talk the shop about music, games, code, design, life, etc. Feel free to shoot over an email and we'll figure it out!

                Always down to play some multiplayer games and chat, feel free to add me! Mortal Kombat 11, Rocket League, and Fortnite are my go-to online games currently.
